└─→ Route Analysis (standalone)
```

## Backend Changes

### No Changes To:
- ✅ Database models (`src/models/`)
- ✅ API routes (`src/routes/`)
- ✅ Data processing logic
- ✅ Chart generation
- ✅ Excel upload functionality
- ✅ Authentication/admin features

### Only Changes:
- ✅ HTML serving routes in `main.py`
- ✅ Frontend HTML files
- ✅ Navigation buttons/links

---

## Data Processing

### Route Analysis Excel Format
**Still works the same way!**

Your Excel file structure:
```
| POINTS | 2025-09-21 | 2025-09-22 | ... | GRAND TOTAL | PREVIOUS WEEK | VARIANCE |
|--------|------------|------------|-----|-------------|---------------|----------|
| ABV    | 11         | 5          | ... | 37          | 46            | -9       |
| ADD    | 44         | 36         | ... | 393         | 291           | 102      |
```

**Processing**:
- ✅ Extracts route codes from "POINTS" column
- ✅ Reads all date columns automatically
- ✅ Calculates metrics from GRAND TOTAL, PREVIOUS WEEK, VARIANCE
- ✅ Generates 5 charts with interactive data
- ✅ Uses active/first sheet (any sheet name works)

**Metrics Calculated**:
1. Total Routes (count of unique routes)
2. Total Passengers (sum of GRAND TOTAL)
3. Previous Week (sum of PREVIOUS WEEK)
4. Week Change (difference and percentage)
5. Top Route (route with highest GRAND TOTAL)
6. Busiest Day (date with highest total passengers)

**Charts Generated**:
1. Top 10 Routes by Passengers (Bar Chart)
2. Daily Passenger Trend (Line Chart)
3. Week-over-Week Comparison (Bar Chart)
4. Passenger Distribution (Doughnut Chart)
5. Top 10 Routes by Growth Rate (Horizontal Bar Chart)

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ Verified Working:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Tested with actual `routeanalysis.xlsx` file
   - 83 routes extracted successfully
   - All 6 date columns parsed correctly
   - Metrics calculated accurately

2. **Data Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": {
       "total_routes": 83,
       "total_passengers": 1672,
       "previous_week_passengers": 1690,
       "variance": -18,
       "variance_pct": -1.07,
       "top_route": "TOTAL",
       "top_route_passengers": 836,
       "busiest_day": "2025-09-23",
       "busiest_day_passengers": 302
     },
     "routes": [...],
     "daily_totals": {...}
   }
   ```

3. **Sample Routes Processed**:
   - ABV: 37 pax (prev: 46, variance: -19.57%)
   - ADD: 393 pax (prev: 291, variance: +35.05%)
   - ACC: 220 pax (prev: 254, variance: -13.39%)

## Backward Compatibility

### Old URLs:
- ✅ `/route-analysis` → Automatically redirects to `/flight-load/route-analysis` (301 redirect)
- ✅ All API endpoints remain unchanged (`/route-analysis/data`, `/route-analysis/charts/*`)
- ✅ Bookmarks will still work (with redirect)

### Browser Behavior:
- Old bookmarks: Will redirect to new location
- Search engines: Will update to new URLs over time
- Direct links: Will work with automatic redirect

---

## Visual Changes

### Home Page
**Before**: 3 cards in a row
**After**: 2 cards, better spacing

### Flight Load Section
**Before**: Direct to load factor dashboard
**After**: Menu page with 2 clear options

### Navigation Buttons
**Before**: Single "Back to Home" button
**After**: Two buttons - "Back to Flight Load" + "Home"

---

## No Impact On

- ✅ Sales Report functionality
- ✅ Admin panel
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Excel upload/processing
- ✅ Chart rendering
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

---

## Deployment Safety

### Low Risk Changes:
- Only HTML and routing changes
- No database schema changes
- No data migration needed
- Backward compatible with redirects

### Rollback Plan:
If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the GitHub commit
2. Render will auto-deploy previous version
3. Or manually restore old files

---

## Summary

**What Changed**: Navigation structure and HTML files
**What Stayed Same**: All backend logic, data processing, and functionality
**Risk Level**: Low (only frontend/routing changes)
**Testing**: Data processing verified with actual Excel file
**Backward Compatibility**: Yes (old URLs redirect)

This is a **safe, non-breaking change** that improves user experience and organization! 🎉
