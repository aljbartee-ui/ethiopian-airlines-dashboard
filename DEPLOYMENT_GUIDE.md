## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Excel Upload Flow

```
User uploads Excel → Backend parses file → Extracts routes → 
Identifies airports → Calculates metrics → Stores in database → 
Returns summary → Frontend displays charts
```

### 2. Data Processing

**Excel Structure:**
```
Row 1: Empty
Row 2: POINTS | Date1 | Date2 | ... | GRAND TOTAL | PREVIOUS WEEK | VARIANCE
Row 3+: CODE  | pax1  | pax2  | ... | total       | prev          | var
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. Read active sheet
2. Parse headers from row 2
3. Extract date columns
4. Read route codes from column 1 (row 3+)
5. Get passenger counts per date
6. Look up airport city/country
7. Calculate totals and variance
8. Store in database

### 3. API Endpoints

```
POST   /flight-load/route-analysis/upload              # Upload Excel
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/data                # Get summary
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/charts/top-destinations
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/charts/daily-trend
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/charts/growth-rates
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/charts/passenger-distribution
GET    /flight-load/route-analysis/charts/week-comparison
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Charts not displaying

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify data was uploaded successfully
3. Check Render logs for backend errors
4. Ensure Chart.js is loading (check network tab)

### Issue: Airport codes showing as "Unknown"

**Solution:**
- The airport_lookup.py database contains 2,000+ codes
- If a code is missing, it will show "Unknown"
- You can add custom codes to the AIRPORT_DATABASE dictionary

### Issue: Upload fails

**Solution:**
1. Check file format (.xlsx or .xls)
2. Verify Excel structure matches expected format
3. Check Render logs for specific error message
4. Ensure UPLOAD_FOLDER is writable

### Issue: 404 Not Found

**Solution:**
1. Verify all files were pushed to GitHub
2. Check Render deployment completed successfully
3. Verify blueprint is registered in main.py
4. Check route URLs match frontend fetch calls

## 📈 Data Requirements

### Excel File Format

**Required:**
- File extension: .xlsx or .xls
- Row 2 must contain headers
- Column 1 must contain airport codes (starting row 3)
- Date columns must be parseable

**Optional:**
- GRAND TOTAL column (will be calculated if missing)
- PREVIOUS WEEK column
- VARIANCE column

**Example:**
```
|       | 2025-09-21 | 2025-09-22 | GRAND TOTAL | PREVIOUS WEEK | VARIANCE |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| ACC   | 59         | 62         | 220         | 254           | -34      |
| ADD   | 44         | 36         | 393         | 291           | +102     |
```
