## üìÅ Excel File Format

Your Excel file should have:
- **Row 2**: Headers (POINTS, dates, GRAND TOTAL, PREVIOUS WEEK)
- **Row 3+**: Route data (airport codes, daily counts, totals)

Example:
```
POINTS | 2025-09-21 | 2025-09-22 | ... | GRAND TOTAL | PREVIOUS WEEK
ABV    | 11         | 5          | ... | 37          | 46
ADD    | 44         | 36         | ... | 393         | 291
```

The system automatically:
- Reads any sheet (uses first/active sheet)
- Calculates variance and growth %
- Identifies top routes and busiest days
- Handles different date formats
